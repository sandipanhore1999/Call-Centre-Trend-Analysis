Call Centre Trends Analysis-

Create a dashboard in Power BI that reflects all relevant Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and metrics in the dataset.

This task requires us to create a dashboard in Power BI that displays all the relevant KPIs and metrics related to call center trends. Possible KPIs include:

* Average customer satisfaction: This KPI measures the satisfaction level of customers who contacted the call center for support.
* Overall calls answered/abandoned: This KPI measures the number of calls answered by agents versus the number of calls abandoned by customers.
* Calls per month: This KPI measures the volume of calls during different months.
* Average speed of answer: This KPI measures the average time taken by agents to answer customer calls.
