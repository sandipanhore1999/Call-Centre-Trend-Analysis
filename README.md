# Call-Centre-Trend-Analysis


# Project Overview
This is a Job simulation Project of "PWC, Switzerland" hosted in "Forage" Platform. 
Here, "PhoneNow" is a Telecom company who is the client of PWC. I completed 3 Power BI Dashboards for "PhoneNow".

# Task 1 
Introduction on Power BI

# Task 2
Call Centre Trends Analysis-

Create a dashboard in Power BI that reflects all relevant Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and metrics in the dataset.

This task requires us to create a dashboard in Power BI that displays all the relevant KPIs and metrics related to call center trends. Possible KPIs include:

* Average customer satisfaction: This KPI measures the satisfaction level of customers who contacted the call center for support.
* Overall calls answered/abandoned: This KPI measures the number of calls answered by agents versus the number of calls abandoned by customers.
* Calls per month: This KPI measures the volume of calls during different months.
* Average speed of answer: This KPI measures the average time taken by agents to answer customer calls.

# Task 3
Customer Retention-
A few weeks after presenting my dashboard to the management, the Retention Manager from the telecom reaches out to you directly. He was impressed by your work and asked if you can put together a dashboard about customer retention.

In addition, to better understand the data, the telecom Retention Manager has scheduled a meeting with the engagement partner at PwC to cover these points:

* Customers in the telecom industry are hard-earned: we don’t want to lose them
* The retention department is here to get customers back in case of termination 
* Currently, we get in touch after they have terminated the contract, but this is reactionary: it would be better to know in advance who is at risk 
* We  have done customer analysis with Excel: it has always ended in a dead-end
* We would like to know more about our customers: visualised clearly so that it’s self-explanatory for our management
* The Retentions Manager has provided some information in the resources.


Define proper KPIs:

This task requires us to define the appropriate KPIs for the retention manager based on the dataset. Create a dashboard for the retention manager reflecting the KPIs:

This task requires us to create a dashboard that displays the defined KPIs for the retention manager to track the customer retention rate. Write a short email to him (the engagement partner) explaining our findings, and include suggestions as to what needs to be changed:
